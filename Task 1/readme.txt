The folder solns of Exp1_21EE62R10 by Sai Joshitha Annareddy(21EE62R10) contains the following:-
1. Python Notebook of Python Code
   Experiment1_BMSEA.ipynb	
2. Exp1_Report(docx) and pdf is given.
3. dat files containing the input data.
4. output images with description in names

steps to execute the code:-

1. The ipynb files can be opened with jupyter notebook interface.
2. Run all the Notebook codes from top to bottom in order to generate all the results.
3. The dat files have to placed in the same directory as the ipynb files in order for the ipynb Notebooks to get executed.
4. Comments are metioned in the code for more clarity
5. Analysis of the Solutions is provided in the report Exp1_Report.docx.

Functions used in python:

numpy library to implement arrays,pi...
from scipy.signal(used to get some signal implementation functions as follows)
freqz_zpk to implement fiter with poles andd zeros
freqz(to plot magnitude response of the filter)
np.correlate to find cross correlation of two different normalized signals
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt for plotting figures
signal.butter to implement butterworth low pass filter
signal.filtfilt to filter the noisy signal using different filters
and other small functions which are commonly used in python code
